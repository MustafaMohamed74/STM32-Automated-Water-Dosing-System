# STM32-Automated-Water-Dosing-System
An embedded system project built using the STM32 microcontroller that automates precise water dosing for applications like hydroponics, irrigation, and liquid measurement systems. The system uses sensors, relays, and a load cell (HX711) to monitor and control water flow accurately, ensuring efficient and consistent dosing.
